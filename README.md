Adams is a personal language model based on the GPT-2 architecture that has been fine-tuned on a dataset of web pages scraped from Google search results. It is designed to be used as a chatbot or conversational agent that can generate human-like responses to user input.

## Release Notes
This release of Adams includes several new features and improvements, including:

- Improved training data preprocessing for better text cleaning and filtering
- Integration with a Google search API to obtain search results more efficiently
- Optimized training hyperparameters to reduce training time and improve model performance
- Enhanced error handling and logging capabilities

## Installation
To install Adams, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/somkietacode/adams.git
```
Then, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using pip:
